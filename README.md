The project consists of creating a shared blog platform where users, after
signing-up, can start writing articles of every kind.
● Whoever is not a member is still allowed to read blog posts but cannot
perform any operation such as Create, Update or Delete on a post.
● Each member can only perform CRUD operations on the posts they created:
For example, user 1 cannot delete user 2’s posts.
